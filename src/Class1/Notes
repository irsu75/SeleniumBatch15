    Selenium Class 1

        What is software testing?
-- identify correctness and quality of the application

       How many ways can we actually test?
-- manual
-- automation

       When do we go for automation?
-- after manual testing is passed
-- when environment is stable
-- analyze our test suite and choose our automation tools

      What other tools do we know for automation?
-- Selenium, UFT/QTP, Cucumber, TestNG, Katalon Studio

      Levels of testing?
-- Unit test
-- Acceptance testing
-- System testing
-- Integration testing

       Types of Testing?
-- Functional testing
-- Non- Functional testing
    Performance testing
    Security testing

       What is Selenium?
-- a set of tools which helps us to automate webb applications. It is mainly used
to perform functional testing.


       What is Selenium WebDriver?
Open source automation tool which allows us to perform actions on a web application
WebDriver is an interface

       Advantages of Selenium WebDriver:
-- open source
-- works with different programming languages--> Java Ruby, C#, JavaScript, Python
-- works with multiple browsers and supports cross browser testing
-- OS independent --> iOS, Linux, Windows

       Disadvantages of Selenium WebDriver:
-- No technical support
-- Cannot test desktop applications
-- no built in reports
-- cannot test captchas, images, videos
-- takes more time to create test cases

        get() vs navigate()
-- navigate can move back, forward and refresh
-- get() will wait for the page to fully load whereas navigate() will not
-- get() will not keep the history of the browser whereas navigate() will

       close() vs quit()
-- close() will close the current tab
-- quit() will quit the whole browser

        fullscreen() vs maximize()
-- maximize() will maximize the browser and you will still be able to see url, tabs, bookmarks
    and fullscreen() will maximize the whole web application

    difference btw get and navigate
    1. get not move forward backward or refresh
    2. get will wait until the whole webpage has loaded then go to next command
    3. navigate can move forward back or refresh methods
    4. navigate won't wait until the whole webpage has loaded then go to next command fast

    Difference btw close and quit
    1. close will close the current tab only
    2. quit will close the whole browser

    Steps to approach a website
    1.Setproperty-->set the path to the chrome driver
    2.create instance of the WebDriver
    3.use driver.get("url") or driver.navigate.to("url")

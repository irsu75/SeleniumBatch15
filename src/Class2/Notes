      8 Locators

 1. ID
 2. Name
 3. Class
 4. linktext--> they can only be used with a link and it must have a text( a link is in the tag - a)
 5. partialinkText--> they can only be used with a link
 6. Tagname
 7. xpath
 8. CSS Selector

      Why do we need so many locators? :0
      ---some times there might be a locator with duplicate value
      ---some times the developers might not provide you with all the locators


      there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator...

      if a attribute value has a number in it , it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator.!!!!

      difference in linktext and partial link Text?
      a partial link text you can use just a part of text,just make sure that is unqiue enough to stand out.

      Locators in selenium help us find the WebElements

      Linktext, partialintext (they can only be used for <a> and it must also have some Text)

      TagName (we just need to pass the tagname and it is going find that particular webelement)

      DOM--> document object model
      here we have the whole code for the website

      Scenario:

      if there are two elements with the same attribute value what will happen?

      selenium is going to get the first one it encounters.
